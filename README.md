# ofxStereoCam180
This project is a proof of concept on 3d side by side video recording by using 2 180ยบ fisheye cameras.
The prototype built uses 2 cameras in an array mode to generate a stereographic stream (real time), with the addition of 3d navigation as result of the 3d mapping and a virtual camera within a skydome.

The App counts with 2 major functionalities:
1. Video recording: files get stored under bin/data/videos.
2. Video streaming: udp only for now.

## Inspiration
The 180ยบ image rectification process is based on the work presented by Paul Burke, [here](http://paulbourke.net/dome/fish2/).

## Captures

### Homemade Camera

I used a small cardboard box with two holes and a couple of pair of screws.

This setup at the top shows up how to capture stereo video for Cardboard applications.

## Resources
The 3d navigation software is implemented in C++ using OpenFrameworks 0.9.  Modules used:
1. ofxGui for menues and settings
2. ofVideoGrabber for video capture
3. ofxVideoRecorder for video recording / live streamming
4. ofSphere / ofBox for skydome
5. OpenGL 3.2 - GLSL v150 for image rectification
6. ffmpeg - video encoding / streaming

## Next Steps
1. Generate real-time video straming for mobile devices (cardboard)
2. Transmit sphere texture instead of rectified captures, in order to make rectification on the mobile device and have real-time tilt/rotation.
2. Build 360ยบ views using an array of 4-5 cameras.
